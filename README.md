OAIX: A Self-Learning AI Framework
OAIX (Open Artificial Intelligence eXperiment) is an evolving AI framework designed to develop a self-learning, adaptive intelligence. Unlike traditional AI models trained on static datasets, OAIX continuously refines its understanding through real-time sensory inputs, recursive neural networks, and dynamic feedback loops.

Project Overview
OAIX is designed as a recursive learning system that processes real-world sensory inputs and generates outputs dynamically. It operates in an infinite feedback loop, improving its intelligence over time by identifying patterns in its environment.

Core Features
✔ Recursive LSTM & CNN Networks – Detects patterns at different levels, refining knowledge dynamically.
✔ Sensory Input System – Processes keyboard, mouse, images, audio, and system stats as sensory data.
✔ Real-Time Adaptation – Learns on the fly without relying on predefined datasets.
✔ Memory Management – Implements short-term and long-term memory with dynamic overwriting.
✔ AI Thought Process Logging – Logs decisions, actions, and learning states for analysis.
✔ Self-Supervised Feedback Loop – Uses its own outputs as future training data.

How It Works
OAIX is structured as a multi-layered processing system, where data flows through several modules:

1️⃣ Sensory Input Module
Collects keyboard, mouse, images, audio, and hardware stats.
Converts sensory data into a continuous logical data stream.
2️⃣ Processing Module (LSTM/CNN Core)
A recursive LSTM structure detects patterns at different granularities.
A CNN/LSTM hybrid model generates intelligent responses.
3️⃣ Action Handler (Port 5012)
Takes AI-generated outputs and performs actions (e.g., UI interactions, text generation).
Feeds executed actions back into the learning loop for reinforcement.
4️⃣ Memory & Learning System
Short-Term Memory (RAM): Constantly rotates data, ensuring real-time learning.
Long-Term Memory (SQL Database): Stores important patterns and past experiences.
